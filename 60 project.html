                <p> Kalpana Chawla flew only 2 missions to space. Her first mission began on November 19th 1997. During her first mission, she did all her work and returned back safely. Her second mission began on January 16th 2003. On 1st of Febuary 2003, NASA's Space shuttle Columbia exploded while reentering Earth's atmosphere, killing all its seven crew members including Kalpana Chawla, the first Indian-origin woman to go to space. The space shuttle was destroyed at about 7:30 PM IST on February 1, 2003, after a 16-day scientific mission. Rick Husband, Micheal Anderson, David Brown, Kalpana Chawla, Laurel Clark, William McCool and Ilan Ramon were the 7 crew members in the Columbia Space shuttle. Rick Husband was the Commander. Micheal Anderson was the Payload Commander. David Brown was the Mission Specialist. Kalpana Chawla was the Mission Specialist. Laurel Clark was the Mission Specialist. William McCool was the pilot. Ilan Ramon was the Payload Specialist. A part of Columbia broke up when it neared the Earth’s surface, which caused a problem while returning. This caused to much heat inside the ship, which cause all the crew members to die. After she dies, one of her brothers said “ She is in a place she is meant to be, among the stars”
                Kalpana Chawla was India’s first woman astronaut. She was born in Karnal in India on July 1, 1961 to a poor family. She was the youngest of the the 4 children. The name ‘Kalpana’ means imagination. Her brothers and sisters called her ‘Montu’ because she was small. Right from when she was small, her dream was to fly to Space. She studied in Tagore Baal Niketan Senior Secondary School, Karnal and her B.Tech in Aeronautical Engineering from Punjab Engineering College at Chandigarh, India in 1982. She was the only girl in Aeronautical Engineering because then girls in India were not allowed go outside and study. From her life, we learnt that we need to work hard inspite of the difficulties and need to achieve in such a way that everyone will remember us even if we die just like Kalpana Chawla and she is also a great inspiration to children like me... She is my inspiration to start loving astronomy, this is because she showed me that the family wealth, background, religion etc don't matter if you really want to achieve something. She also showed me that we should never give up no matter what happens</p>
